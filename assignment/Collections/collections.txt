1. What is Collection framework in Java?
Ans :
Collection is a architect which has classes and interface.
the collection framework is contains the interface and classes of data structures
the datastructures are so that it stores the data in dynamic size.

2. What is the difference between ArrayList and LinkedList?
Ans : 
ArrayList :
the index based storing is done.
it stores as dynamic array
it stores in sequence memory internally.

LinkedList :
there is  no index based storing is done.
it stores as doubly linked List.
It stores randomly in memory internally.

3.What is the difference between Iterator and ListIterator?
Ans :
Iterator :
Iterator is the superclass of the Iterator.
Iterator can be used to any data structures.
Iterator is only used to move only forward.

ListIterator:
ListIterator is a subclass of Iterator.
ListIterator is only used to list type of data structures.
ListIterator is used to move both forward and backward.


4. What is the difference between Iterator and Enumeration?
Ans : 
Iterator :
the Iterator can traverse legacy and non-legacy elements.
it fall fast.
it is slower than Enumeration.


Enumeration:
it can traverse only legacy elements.
it does't fall fast.
it is faster than Enumeration.

5. What is the difference between List and Set?
Ans :
List :
It can contains the duplicates.
list is an ordered collection.
list allows number of null.

Set:
It cannot contain duplicates.
it is unorderd collections stores in random location.
it allows only one null value.

6. What is the difference between HashSet and TreeSet?
Ans: 
HashSet:
It stores the data in unordered ,hence it is unordered collection
search is very easy in hashset as it has time complexity of o(1)
the memory management is less.

TreeSet:
it stores the data in sorted way.
search is inefficient when compared to hashset. 
the memory management is more compared to hashset.

7. What is the difference between Array and ArrayList?
Ans :
Array :
it is not dynamic as it is static
it is not the part of collection
only one type of data can be stored at once.

ArrayList: 
it is dynamic in nature.
it is part of collection.
any data type of data can be used to store in it.

8. What is a Map in Java?
Ans:
the map is a datastructures which stores the data as a key pair values.each key must be 
unique.

9.  What are the commonly used implementations of Map in Java?
Ans : the HashMap, treeMap, linkedhashmap.

10.What is the difference between HashMap and TreeMap?
Ans ;
HashMap :
it is unordered collection.
it has key value pair.
it stores the data based on hash algorithm .


treeMap:
it store in sorted ordered.
it doesnot have key value pair.
it is not based on hash algorithm.

11. How do you check if a key exists in a Map in Java?
Ans: with the help of .containsKey() method . it has return type of Boolean data type.
