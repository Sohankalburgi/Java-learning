1. What is encapsulation in Java? What is called Data Hiding?
Ans: encapsulation is an technique which is used to encapsulate the data of the program which 
cannot be accessable to the public world. the accessibilty is only limited to private class.
the Data Hiding is an feature of encapsulation technique. it is essentiallty protecting the 
data of the class from being altered or modified by the public members.

2. What are the important features of encapsulation?
Ans: Data Hiding : it is essentiallty protecting the data of the class from being altered 
or modified by the public class. It makes the code and data to be on safer side.

Data Abstraction : the data Abstraction is feature that does the part of work without 
knowing the internal working of it thereby protecting it from data breach.

access control : it feature of encapsulation also provides to specify the accessibilty to
the data members and data methods of the class. hence it is much more secure or it is 
type of a guard to the data members and methods.

Modularity : the bigger problems are separately solved by smaller pecies and then merge together 
to solve the problem . it makes more efficent.

3. What are getter and setter methods in Java Explain with an example?
Ans : the getter and setter method is used to display and initialise the data of the another class
whose data members are in private specified.

the setter() is used to set the value to the variable.
the getter() is used to get or display the value of the variable. 

the  setter must use the void return type as it doesnt have to return any value.
but the getter can use any return type except "None",  

the setter and getter must be in public accessibilty.

class student{
    private int age; // private instance variable
    

    public void setAge(int age) 
    {
        this.age = age;
    }

    public int getAge()
    {
        return age;
    }
}
class settersAndGetters {
    public static void main(String args[])
    {
        student obj1 = new student();
        student obj2 = new student();
        obj1.setAge(18);
        int age1 = obj1.getAge();
        int age2 = obj2.getAge();
        System.out.println(age1);
        System.out.println(age2); 
    }}
4. What is the use of this Keyword explain with an example?
Ans: the Keyword this is used to take the class instance variable.
class student{
    private int age; // private instance variable
    public void setAge(int age) 
    {
        this.age = age; // here the this Keyword makes the age to act as age variable of instance.
    }
}

5. WHat is the advantage of encapsulation?
Ans: the advantages are:
a. it provides the data security.
b. it helps to provide the accessibilty to an each part of data and code of the program
c. it helps to solve the problem much easier with the help of Modularity.

6. How do we achieve encapsulation in Java? Give an example.
Ans: the encapsulation can be achieve and it can be explained by the example.
class student{
    private int age; // private instance variable
    

    public void setAge(int age) 
    {
        this.age = age;
    }

    public int getAge()
    {
        return age;
    }
}
class settersAndGetters {
    public static void main(String args[])
    {
        student obj1 = new student();
        obj1.setAge(18);
        int age1 = obj1.getAge();
        System.out.println(age1);
    }}
the data of age is in private hence it cannot be accessable to public hence data is secure and 
encapsulated further the use of setter and getter to access the data without disturbing the 
access specifier of instance variable. hence this is how encapsulation is achieved.
