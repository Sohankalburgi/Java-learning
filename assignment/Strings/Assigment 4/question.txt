4. How do you compare two String in Java? give example.
Ans : the comparison is done with the help of equals() method and "==" operator.

the "==" is majorly used to check the String object is referring to same object address
the equals() method is used to check the content of String is same or equal.

for eg:

String s = "hi";
String s1 = "hi";
System.out.println(s==s1); // false  the address of s and s1 is different 
System.out.println(s.equals(s1)); // true the content of s and s1 is same
