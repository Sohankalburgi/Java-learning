What is Mutable String in Java? Give Example ?
Ans:
the Mutable String object is created using the StringBuilder and StringBuffer object which is present in Java. The mutable String is a string which can change its value. the value doesn't remain constant over the entire program. 
For example :

class stringex{

public static void main (String args[]){
	String s = new String ("hello"); // the string s is initalised by "hello"
	s.concat("world")  // s is concatenated by "world"
	System.out.println(s); // the output is "hello"
	StringBuilder p = new StringBuilder ("hello"); // mutable string object is created
	p.append("world"); // the "world" is appended 
	System.out.println(p); // the output is "helloworld"
}
}
