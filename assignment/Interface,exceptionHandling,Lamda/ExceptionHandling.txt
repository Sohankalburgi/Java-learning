1. Explain different types of error in Java?
Ans : 
compile time error:
* it is also called syntax error
* this error can be realized during compilation.

run time error:
* it is also called logic error.
* this error is encountered when the program is runned or when the logic is wrong.

2. What is exception in Java?
Ans : 
the exception in the natural logic flow of the program is called exception in Java.

3. How can you handle exception in Java? with an example.
Ans : 
the exception handling can be done in Java by using the two important keywords 
try and catch.
* the try block performs the set of instruction in it even if it is an error.
* the catch block accepts the error or exception and executes the set of instruction in 
the catch block.

example 
try{
    int res = 8/0;
}
catch(ArithmeticException er)
{
    System.out.println(er.getMessage());
}

4. Why do we need exception handling in Java?
Ans :
the exception handling is necessary in order  not to disturb the flow of the profram 
for the exception cases.hence these cases needed to be dealt in other way hence we need
exception handling in Java.

5. what is the difference between exception and error?
Ans : Errors are occured during the application run as due to the memory out of space 
and exception is error which occurs due to the program code .

6. Name the different types of exceptions in Java.
Ans: 
* checked exception
* unchecked exception

7. Can we just use try instead of finally and catch blocks?
Ans :
No, we catch block along with try as catch block takes the exception object and handles it.
