1. What is Input and Output Stream in Java?
Ans:
Input Stream and Output Stream belongs to IO package.
Input Stream is used to take the input of the serialised class of object.
OutputStream is used to write the object of the serialised class.

2.  What are the Methods of OutputStream?
Ans:
OutputStream contains many Methods the most important are:
flush() - method is used to retrieve the Output to javatype file to other file.
close() - it is used to close the OutputStream object of created by ObjectOutputStream or FileOutputStream class
write() - it convert the file or object into the bytes.

3. What is serialization in Java?
Ans : The process of converting the object of the class into the byte code
with the help of the abstract class Serializable.
the main use of this is to store the javafile info into the secure file other than javatype.

4.What is the Serializable interface in Java?
Ans :
the Serializable interface is an abstract class which can be inherited by
the keyword implements to the class which is needed to be Serialized. this is uesed
to convert the javatype to other type in form of bytes.this is writing process.

5. What is Deserialization in Java?
Ans:
the process of reading the object of the class which is already serialised. it converts the 
destructured object to structured object by taking the input of the Deserialization to the java file.

6.How is serialization achieved in Java?
Ans:
The serialization can be achieved in Java because of Serializable interface. the serialistion
makes the object convert into stream of bytes which can be transferrable ot the sother file like network,database.

7.How is deserialization achieved in Java?
Ans :
the deserialization is converting the stream of bytes into the real original object. the deserializable object 
is constructed back to its structured object form with the help of readObject() method.

8.How can you avoid certain member variables of class from getting Serialized?
Ans:
Mark the member variables as transient.

9. What classes are available in the Java IO File Classes API?
Ans:
File
FileWriter
FileReader
BufferWriter
BufferReader
FileInputStream
FileOutputStream

10. What is Difference between Externalizable and Serialization interface ?
Ans:
Serializable
it is marker interface
it provides own Serializable process we just need to used Serializable interface
it provide less control
Externalizable
it is not marker interface
we need to override with writeExternal() and readExternal()
Externalizable control.
